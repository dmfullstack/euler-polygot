Solving Euler Problems in as many languages as I find.

If you want to run these programs, you should have the languages installed at minimum

Run: 
  
  Ruby:
    ruby test_solution.rb

  Javascript:
    npm install -g mocha
    mocha (in javascript root)

  Python:
    python test_solution.py

  Go:
    go test

  Java:
    install the java sdk
    install junit appropriately
    javac Solution.java SolutionTest.java TestRunner.java
    java TestRunner
